# Task ID: 12
# Title: Remove git subrepos and finalize repository structure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: After migration is complete, remove git subrepo tracking from the umbrella repository to transition to standard package dependencies
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Remove git subrepo configuration and tracking files [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Remove all git subrepo configuration files, tracking metadata, and related git configurations from the umbrella repository
### Details:
Remove .gitrepo files for SundialKitCore, SundialKitNetwork, and SundialKitConnectivity subrepos. Remove git subrepo configuration from git config. Clean up any subrepo-specific git hooks or metadata files that were created during the subrepo setup process.

## 2. Update Package.swift to use standard package dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Replace subrepo path dependencies with proper Swift Package Manager dependencies pointing to the separate repositories
### Details:
Modify Package.swift to replace local path dependencies for SundialKitCore, SundialKitNetwork, and SundialKitConnectivity with proper package dependencies using .package(url:, from:) syntax. Update target dependencies to reference the external packages. Ensure version constraints are properly specified for each dependency.

## 3. Remove local source directories for subrepo packages [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2
### Description: Remove the local Sources subdirectories that were managed by git subrepo for the core packages
### Details:
Remove Sources/SundialKitCore, Sources/SundialKitNetwork, and Sources/SundialKitConnectivity directories from the umbrella repository since these are now managed as separate repositories. Update .gitignore to ensure these directories are not accidentally re-added. Clean up any build artifacts or derived data related to these local sources.

## 4. Update CI/CD workflows and scripts [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Modify GitHub Actions workflows and build scripts to handle standard package dependencies instead of subrepo management
### Details:
Update .github/workflows files to remove git subrepo commands and replace with standard swift package manager commands. Modify Scripts/build.sh and other build scripts to remove subrepo-specific logic. Update CI to use swift package resolve instead of git subrepo pull. Remove any subrepo-specific environment variables or configurations from CI.

## 5. Update documentation and README for standard package structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.4
### Description: Update project documentation to reflect the transition from subrepos to standard Swift Package Manager dependencies
### Details:
Update README.md to remove references to git subrepo commands and replace with standard SPM usage. Modify CLAUDE.md to remove subrepo-related development instructions. Update any developer documentation that referenced the subrepo structure. Add instructions for contributing to the separate repositories. Update package dependency examples in documentation.

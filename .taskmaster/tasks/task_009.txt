# Task ID: 9
# Title: Migrate all tests to Swift Testing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Convert entire test suite from XCTest to Swift Testing framework across all packages (requires Swift 6.1+ - Swift 5.9/5.10/6.0 support dropped)
# Details:
Comprehensive Swift Testing migration:

**Prerequisites**: Swift 6.1+ is now required. Support for Swift 5.9, 5.10, and 6.0 has been dropped to enable Swift Testing adoption. Package@swift-5.9.swift manifests removed, CI/CD updated to test only Swift 6.1+ builds.

1. Core package tests (SundialKitCore, Network, Connectivity):
   - Replace XCTestCase with @Test functions
   - Convert XCTAssert* to Swift Testing assertions
   - Use @Suite for test organization
   - Parameterized tests for multiple scenarios
2. Plugin package tests:
   - SundialKitCombine: Publisher testing with Swift Testing
   - SundialKitMessagable: Encoding/decoding tests
3. Testing utilities:
   - Mock implementations using Swift Testing
   - Test fixtures and helpers
   - Async test support
4. CI/CD updates:
   - GitHub Actions configuration
   - Code coverage reporting
   - Test performance tracking
5. Documentation:
   - Testing guide for contributors
   - Example test patterns

Tools: Xcode 16+, Swift 6.1+, swift test command

# Test Strategy:
Meta-testing: Verify all tests pass, maintain or improve code coverage (target 90%+), ensure CI/CD pipeline works, validate test performance.

# Subtasks:

### Dependencies: None
### Description: Convert all SundialKitCore test files from XCTest to Swift Testing, including protocol conformance tests and mock implementations
### Details:
Replace XCTestCase with @Test functions and @Suite for organization. Convert all XCTAssert statements to Swift Testing assertions (#expect, #require). Update mock implementations to use Swift Testing patterns. Ensure Sendable conformance tests are properly migrated. Update test file imports from XCTest to Testing framework.

## 2. Migrate NetworkMonitor and PathMonitor tests with mocks [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Convert NetworkMonitor tests in SundialKitNetwork from XCTest to Swift Testing, including all mock implementations and observer patterns
### Details:
Convert NetworkObserverTests, NWPathMonitorTests, NWInterfaceTests, and PathStatusNetworkTests from XCTest to Swift Testing. Migrate MockPathMonitor and MockNetworkPing to Swift Testing patterns. Convert observer notification tests using @Test with async support. Update thread safety tests to use Swift Testing concurrency features. Convert state change tests to use parameterized testing with @Test(arguments:). Ensure platform-specific behavior tests work on all supported platforms.

## 3. Migrate ConnectivityManager tests with platform scenarios [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Convert ConnectivityManager tests in SundialKitConnectivity from XCTest to Swift Testing, handling iOS and watchOS specific behaviors
### Details:
Migrate ConnectivityObserver tests (ConnectivityObserverInternalTests, ConnectivityObserverMessageTests, ConnectivityObserverPropertyTests) to Swift Testing. Convert MockConnectivitySession and delegate pattern tests. Update platform-specific tests using @available annotations with Swift Testing. Convert message sending/receiving tests to use async testing patterns. Migrate timeout and fallback mechanism tests. Convert reachability change tests to use parameterized testing for different scenarios.

## 4. Convert SundialKitCombine plugin tests to Swift Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Migrate all Combine publisher tests from XCTest to Swift Testing, including NetworkObserver and ConnectivityObserver reactive tests
### Details:
Convert PassthroughSubjectTests and publisher testing from XCTest expectations to Swift Testing async/await patterns. Migrate PassthroughSubject tests and anyPublisher(for:) extension tests. Update subscription lifecycle tests using Swift Testing features. Convert publisher value and completion tests to use #expect with async support. Ensure all reactive streams are properly tested.

## 5. Convert SundialKitMessagable plugin tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Migrate Messagable protocol tests and MessageDecoder tests from XCTest to Swift Testing framework
### Details:
Convert MessagableTests, MessageDecoderTests, ConnectivitySendContextTests, and ConnectivityReceiveContextTests from XCTest to Swift Testing. Migrate encoding/decoding tests to use Swift Testing assertions. Update MockMessage implementations to Swift Testing patterns. Convert type registration tests using parameterized testing for multiple message types. Convert ConnectivityMessage dictionary tests. Ensure property list compatibility tests are properly migrated.

## 6. Update CI/CD configuration for Swift Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5
### Description: Modify GitHub Actions workflows and scripts to support Swift Testing framework and reporting
### Details:
Update GitHub Actions workflow to use swift test with Swift Testing support. Configure code coverage reporting to work with Swift Testing output. Update test result formatting for GitHub Actions annotations. Ensure parallel test execution is properly configured. Add test performance tracking and reporting. Update matrix testing for all supported platforms.

## 7. Create testing utilities and migration documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5
### Description: Develop Swift Testing utilities, helpers, and comprehensive documentation for contributors
### Details:
Create common test utilities using Swift Testing patterns (fixtures, helpers, custom assertions). Document Swift Testing best practices and patterns specific to SundialKit. Create migration guide from XCTest to Swift Testing for future contributors. Develop example test patterns for different scenarios (async, actors, publishers). Update README with testing instructions using Swift Testing.
